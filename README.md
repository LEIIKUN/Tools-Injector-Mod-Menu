# Known Issue

- Does not work on Windows 7 or 32 bit.

# Tested - Feedback
‚óè Does not work.

1.) Tried on both windows 7 64 bit and windows 10 64 bit and successfully compiled without getting any error. But when apk got installed, the mod won't run and always stopped.


2.) Tried two different games with different hex code, function and method; both armv7 with correct offset and hex code.


3.) Tried on emulator (android 5.1.1 & android 8.0) and real device (android 4.4), still stopped.
